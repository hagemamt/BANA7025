      <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this <strong>individual/pair</strong> final project is
 to put to work the tools and knowledge that you gain throughout this 
course. This provides you with multiple benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It will provide you with more experience using data wrangling tools on real life data sets.</li>
  <li>It helps you become a self-directed learner. As a data scientist, a
 large part of your job is to self-direct your learning and interests to
 find unique and creative ways to find insights in data.</li>
  <li>It starts to build your data science portfolio. Establishing a 
data science portfolio is a great way to show potential employers your 
ability to work with data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The course is structured in a way that allows you to work on your project as you progress through the weeks. Thus, you <em>should</em>
 not have to cram during the last two weeks of the term to complete your
 project. Rather, I plan to have you work on the project and use some of
 the in-class time to do peer evaluation of your code.</p>

<h3 id="project-goal">Project Goal</h3>

<p>The principal goal of this project is to import a real life data set,
 clean and tidy the data, and perform basic exploratory data analysis; 
all while using R Markdown to produce an HTML report that is fully 
reproducible.</p>

<h3 id="project-data">Project Data</h3>

<p>You will need to select one data set from the four that I have 
supplied below.  All four data sets contain key attributes that will 
demonstrate the data science capabilities that you have learned 
throughout this couse.  You may even need to learn new skills not taught
 to accomplish your mission.  These include working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multiple data types (numerics, characters, dates, etc)</li>
  <li>non-normalized characteristics (may contain punctuations, upper and lowercase letters, etc)</li>
  <li>data sets that need to be merged</li>
  <li>unclean data (missing values, values that do not align to the data dictionary)</li>
  <li>variables that need to be created (i.e. the data may contain 
income and expense variables but you want to analyze savings such that 
you need to create a savings variable out of the income and expense 
variables)</li>
  <li>data that needs to be filtered out</li>
  <li>and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Available data sets include:</p>

<p>You can choose from one of the following four data sets.  Each dataset has its own challenges and strengths.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Petfinder.com Dog Data

</ul>

<p><em>Note</em>: Your homework group members may or may not all select 
the same dataset.  If members in your peer group select the same 
dataset, your work should reflect an individual/pair effort.  The 
Lindner College of Business academic integrity policy applies here.</p>

<h3 id="project-report">Project Report</h3>

<p>You will write an <a href="http://wfu-r.github.io/r_markdown">R Markdown</a>
 HTML report that provides the sections in the grading rubric below.  
You will need to import, assess, clean &amp; tidy the data, and then 
come up with your own research questions that you would like to answer 
from the data by performing exploratory data analysis (if you’d like to 
perform a predictive model to answer your hypothesis that is fine but it
 is not required).  Some thoughts to help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/11/20/18099001/animated-films-storyboards-script-story-ralph-breaks-the-internet">Make a storyboard</a>.
  Your project should be a logical, cohesive story–not simply a bunch of
 graphs created for the sake of making them.  The story may change as 
you dive deeper into the data and find insights, but a storyboard gives 
you direction and purpose for developing insights.  Clear writing means a
 clear mind, and a storyboard is vital to producing a good story.</li>
  <li>Speaking of insights, keep in mind that your project should follow
 the chain of data -&gt; insights -&gt; actions.  As a future data 
analyst (or data scientist, or statistician, or whatever is trendy next 
year), you work to create insights that lead to actions, not to waste 40
 hours on a awe-inspiring visualization that is ignored directly after a
 presentation and never used again.</li>
  <li>Simple descriptive statistics can (and usually) yield more of an immediate impact than a complicated model.  <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/r-at-the-aclu-joining-tables-to-to-reunite-families">Brooke Watson</a>
 gave a compelling and enlightening presentation at the 2019 RStudio 
Conference on how the ACLU used various R packages to count and reunite 
families.</li>
  <li>Do subgroups matter in your data?</li>
  <li>Why are data missing?</li>
  <li>Are trends over time important?</li>
</ul>

<p>Although each data set’s data dictionary contains some additional 
questions worth pursuing, try to be creative in your analysis and 
investigate the data in a way that your classmates most likely will not.
  Creativity is an essential ingredient for a good data scientist!</p>

did the original have, explain any peculiarities of the source data such
 as how missing values are recorded, or how data was imputed, etc.). <br>

me with a consolidated explanation, either with a table that provides 
summary info for each variable or a nicely written summary paragraph 
with inline code.

<p>I expect your report to tell a story with the data. I do not want you
 to just report some statistics that you find but, rather, to provide a 
coherent narrative of your findings. Here are some examples of the type 
of report that I am looking for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/final_project_example">State-level savings rates</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/murphm6/233993">Undergraduate student diversity</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/ishantnayer/234221">AirBnB sentiment</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/hailce17/301571">Capital punishment in America</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/dyang9411/301598">Ideal cities and states for analytic students</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/yash91sharma/dw_project_ys">Movie exploratory analysis</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/angiechen/234334">AirBnB user pathways</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Upon submission you will upload the final HTML report to RPubs and 
provide me with the URL. You will also submit the .Rmd file that 
produced the HTML report, your data, and any other files your .Rmd file 
leverages (images, .bib file, etc.). Your submitted files should be 
named with year, course number, lastname, first &amp; middle initial, 
and then “finalproject.” For example my file name would be: 
2020_BANA7025_jodreyjt_finalproject.Rmd.  I expect to be able to fully 
reproduce your report by knitting your .Rmd file.</p>

<p><strong>Optional:</strong>  For those who are more advanced or daring, I challenge you to develop a <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny app</a> using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a>
 to accompany your report. This will turn your exploratory data analysis
 into an interactive tool for users.  Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bradleyboehmke.shinyapps.io/us_savings_rate_app/">U.S. Savings Rates</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bradleyboehmke.shinyapps.io/LPI_Rankings/">International Logistics Performance Index</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/steffanigomez/301609">Craft Beer in the U.S.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rpubs.com/AlinaC/final_project">Co2 Emmissions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://zhanb17.shinyapps.io/mcdonaldsnutrition/">McDonald’s Nutrition Facts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any additional details regarding the final project will be provided in class.</p>
