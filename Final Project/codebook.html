      <td align="left">
        Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a
        combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat
        strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and
        1.0 is most danceable.

      <td align="left">double</td>
      <td align="left">
        Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure
        of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud,
        and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach
        prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to
        this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset
        rate, and general entropy.

      <td align="left">key</td>
      <td align="left">double</td>
      <td align="left">
        The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using
        standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.
        If no key was detected, the value is -1.

      <td align="left">loudness</td>
      <td align="left">double</td>
      <td align="left">
        The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are
        averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative
        loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the
        primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values
        typical range between -60 and 0 db.

      <td align="left">mode</td>

      <td align="left">
        Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of
        scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by
        1 and minor is 0.

      <td align="left">speechiness</td>

      <td align="left">
        Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more
        exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book,
        poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66
        describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values
        between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and
        speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap
        music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other
        non-speech-like tracks.

      <td align="left">double</td>
      <td align="left">
        A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
        1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

      <td align="left">instrumentalness</td>
      <td align="left">double</td>
      <td align="left">
        Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are
        treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are
        clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the
        greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5
        are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher
        as the value approaches 1.0.

        Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness
        values represent an increased probability that the track was performed
        live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is
        live.

      <td align="left">
        A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed
        by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy,
        cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative
        (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
